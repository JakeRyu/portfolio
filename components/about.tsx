      <p className="mb-3">
        I was born and raised in South Korea, where I got my education and
        started my journey as a web developer. An exciting project with Hyundai
        Motor brought me to the UK, and now I happily live and work here as a
        full-stack developer.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-3">
        I&apos;ve been in web programming since 2000, and it&apos;s been amazing
        to see and be part of the evolution of web applications. My career has
        taken me through a variety of projects, from large-scale ERP systems to
        mobile investment apps for startups, with a strong focus on .NET-based
        projects.

      <p className="mb-3">
        In my work, I love using{" "}

        are very important to meâ€”they help me create reliable and maintainable
        software.

      <p className="mb-3">
        When I&apos;m not coding, I enjoy watching English Premier League (EPL)
        matches. I also love attending developer conferences and diving into a
        good book, whether it&apos;s a novel or a self-improvement guide.
